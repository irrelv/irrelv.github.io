    <h1>Deckbuilder</h1>
    <div id="text-block">
      <p>
        This is a short bullet hell game with deckbuilder elements. The primary
        goal is to survive waves of increasingly powerful enemies while also
        upgrading a "deck" of bullets. Every few waves, the player will have the
        opportunity to add a bullet to their deck. Bullets are fired out in a
        random order, as if they were in a deck of cards that is shuffled every
        time the cannon reloads.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are 7 zones of difficulty, each with a varying amount of waves. When the player has cleared a zone, they can add a powerful passive relic to their
        arsenal instead of a bullet. These relics give a passive buff and allow
        for interesting synergies or open new gameplay paths.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game uses a 4-element status system where different types of bullets
        inflict different effects on enemies. Building a deck around these
        elements is important to maximize damage output. The status effects
        are explained in detail in the ingame instructions menu.
      </p>

      <p>
        The average length of a game is 20 minutes. There are a total of 20
        different types of bullets and 25 different relics available to the
        player.
      </p>

      <p>
          The game uses free art assets provided by the talented people at <a href=https://game-icons.net/>https://game-icons.net/</a>.
